# NAVAECI: Non-Asymptotically Valid and Asymptotically Exact (NAVAE) Confidence Intervals


## Installation

You can install the development version of NAVAECI from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AlexisDerumigny/NAVAECI")
```

## Confidence interval for the mean

```{r}
library(NAVAECI)

n = 4000
x = rexp(n, rate = 1/3)  # so the mean is 3
Navae_ci_mean(x, bound_K = 9, alpha = 0.1)
```

## Confidence interval for the linear regression

```{r}
n = 4000
X1 = rnorm(n, sd = 1)
true_eps = rnorm(n)
Y = 2 + 8 * X1 + true_eps

Navae_ci_ols(Y, X1, K_xi = 3, a = 1.1)
```
